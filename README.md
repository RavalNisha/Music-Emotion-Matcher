## ðŸ§  Core Components

The system comprises three interconnected modules:

1. **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)**  
   Uses computer vision (OpenCV + DeepFace) to analyze facial expressions and detect emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more.

2. **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)**  
   Extracts features from user audio (via microphone) using **Librosa** and classifies emotions with a **CNN model** built using TensorFlow/Keras.

3. **Music Recommendation Engine**  
   Maps the detected emotions to relevant music genres and uses the **Spotify Web API** to generate emotion-based playlists.
